### Problem 1

You are given a string formed by concatenating several words corresponding to the integers zero through nine and then anagramming.

For example, the input could be ```'niesevehrtfeev'```, which is an anagram of '```threefiveseven'```. Note that there can be multiple instances of each integer.

Given this string, return the original integers in sorted order. In the example above, this would be ```357```.


### Problem 2

Write a function that rotates a list by k elements.

For example, 
```[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]```
rotated by two becomes 
```[3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2]```. 

Try solving this without creating a copy of the list. How many swap or move operations do you need?
